### (1) Inventory impact (File: Inventory_impact.ipynb)
Figure 1 in manuscript which displays the plot generated from the data sourced from the US Census Bureau (2023) showing an overall increase in inventories and sales from 2000 to 2023 in three sectors (wholesale, retail, and manufacturing). 

### (2) Distribution of product demand (File: demand distribution plot.ipynb)
Figure 3 in manuscript displays the distribution plots, which provide insights into the central tendency and dispersion of demand data for each product.
