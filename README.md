## Monte Carlo Simulation and Importance Sampling: A Case Study on Demand Uncertainty Management

### (1) Inventory impact (File: Inventory_impact.ipynb)
Figure 1 in manuscript which displays the plot generated from the data sourced from the US Census Bureau (2023) showing an overall increase in inventories and sales from 2000 to 2023 in three sectors (wholesale, retail, and manufacturing). 

### (2) Approximation of target PDF by random measure (File: Importance sampling approach.ipynb)
Figure 3 in manuscript displays the approximation of the target PDF along with the actual PDF for comparison. By comparing the approximation curve with the target PDF, it can be visually assessed how well the MCS, along with Importance Sampling, approximates the target distribution. 

### (3) Data distribution in Importance Sampling compared to Random Sampling (File: histogram_(random_vs_IS).ipynb)
Figure 4 in manuscript displays that Importance Sampling with appropriately chosen weights, can more efficiently estimate probabilities and expected values for regions where the standard Monte Carlo method would require a large number of samples.

### (4) Distribution of product demand (File: demand distribution plot.ipynb)
Figure 5 in manuscript displays the distribution plots, which provide insights into the central tendency and dispersion of demand data for each product.

### (5) File: Random & Importance sampling-Comparison.ipynb
- Table 5 in manuscript displays the comparison between Random Sampling and Importance Sampling where simulation is being run with 1000 samples each
- Figure 7 in manuscript displays the profit distribution for all four products, which helps to understand the variability in profitability across different scenarios.
