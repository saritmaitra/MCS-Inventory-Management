## Monte Carlo Simulation and Importance Sampling: A Case Study on Demand Uncertainty Management

### (1) Inventory impact (File: Inventory_impact.ipynb)
Figure 1 in manuscript which displays the plot generated from the data sourced from the US Census Bureau (2023) showing an overall increase in inventories and sales from 2000 to 2023 in three sectors (wholesale, retail, and manufacturing). 

### (2) Distribution of product demand (File: demand distribution plot.ipynb)
Figure 3 in manuscript displays the distribution plots, which provide insights into the central tendency and dispersion of demand data for each product.

### (3) Simulation logic and continuous review inventory policy (File: Simulation & Continuous review.ipynb)

### (4) Simulation logic and periodic review inventory policy (File: Simulation & periodic review.ipynb)

### (5) Convergence plots (File: Convergence_plot.ipynb)
Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, and Figure 8 collectively help in assessing the convergence and reliability of MCS results. They provide insights into how quickly the estimates stabilize, the presence of biases or trends in the simulations, and the precision of the profit estimates

### (6) Optimization using grid search and Bayesian optimization (File: optimization.ipynb)
